The function **ARROW->** serves the purpose of decoding an Arrow stream (BYTES) with the resulting type being determined by the value of *WarpScriptConversionMode*. If there is no specified conversion mode in the input's metadata, the default PAIR conversion mode is utilized. The function accepts the following parameters: **WarpScriptConversionMode** (defines the conversion mode to be used, taking precedence if set), **bytes** (the Arrow stream that needs to be decoded), and **result** (the output, which is the decoded object). Related functions include **ARROWTO** and **TOARROW**. The function is tagged with **arrow**, indicating its relevance to operations involving Arrow data formats, and falls under categories related to data processing and transformation in geo time series applications.
